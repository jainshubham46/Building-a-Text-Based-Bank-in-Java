1.Question 1
Which language did we use to develop our program?


Eclipse ///ans
Ubuntu
Java
C




2.Question 2
Which of the Following is a Disadvantage of Java?


Java is slower than directly compiled languages like C  ///ANS


Java is dynamically typed


Java is too old to be used on modern operating systems


Java is too expensive for personal developers to get started

Correct
Correct! Java is slower than compiled languages than C because it must first be compiled into JVM machine code and then this code must be interpreted into normal machine code. A language like C directly translates into normal machine code, and is thus faster.


3.Question 3
How are System.out.print(...) and System.out.println(...) different


Print puts spaces between words while println puts a new line between words


Println places a new line after the statement while print does not ///ANS 


They are not different


None of the options are correct

Correct
Println indicates that we place a new line after outputting the statement in between the parentheses, while print does not.


4.Question 4
Which of the following is correct Java code


System.out.println(I + like + to + run);


System.out.println("I like to run");  ///ANS


System.out.println("I like to run")

Correct
This is correct Java code. The string is contained inside of the parentheses and double quotations. We also have proper capitalization and a semicolon at the end


5.Question 5
True or False? An else statement can exist without an if statement.


True


False  ///ANS

Correct
An else statement only occurs executes if the if statement evaulates to False. As a result we need an if statement anytime we have a else statement, however not every if statement requires an else statement.


6.Question 6
According to Java's definition of a floating point, which of the following are floating point values?


22


14.121221

Correct
This is a floating point because it contains a decimal point. There can be any number of values after the decimal point.


-12.2

Correct
This is a floating point because it contains a decimal point. Doubles can be negative


-50.0

Correct
This is a floating point because it contains a decimal point. Even if the value after the decimal point is 0, it is still a floating point number.


7.Question 7
What index do arrays start counting at in Java? (What is always the first index in an array?)


0    ////ANS


Array.size()


Array.size() - 1


1

Correct
Arrays in Java start at index 0. This is because the index measures the offset of each value from the first value, thus the first value is offset by 0 spaces from itself.


8.Question 8
What happens if a user enters more than 250 customers into our bank.


The program terminates and throws an exception  ///ANS.


The program silently creates an error, by overwriting the first customer with the new customer's data.


The computer crashes due to an overflow error


The program adds the 251st customer without error

Correct
In Java adding too many values to an array causes a memory problem, and will cause an exception. Unless handled (which we did not) the program will terminate and output an error message.

9.Question 9
How do you terminate a program in Java from inside the program?


System.out.exit(2);


System.exit(5);   ////ANS


system.Exit(1);


System.quit(2);

Correct
System.exit(status code); allows us to terminate our program when that line of code is executed.

1 / 1 point

Which of the following is not a valid loop-continuation condition?


20 >= 15


True


int x = 5      ///ANS


All of the above are valid

Correct
